# Obsidian Plugin: Clean iCloud Sync

When using iCloud to sync Obsidian notes between multiple devices, sometimes iCloud is unable to resolve conflicts in multiple versions of a note. The intent of this plugin is to clean up the sync artificats: automatically where possible, by providing help when the user needs to help, or at least to flag sync problems for the user.
